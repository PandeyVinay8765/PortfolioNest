        <p>
          ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Vinay Pandey
          <br /><br />
          I'm a passionate full-stack developer and a final-year B.Tech student at IET Lucknow.
          I love building web applications using the MERN stack and solving real-world problems
          with clean, efficient code.
          <br /><br />
          With a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms, I actively sharpen my
          coding skills on platforms like LeetCode and GFG. My current focus is on:
          <br />
          - Developing responsive frontends using ReactJS + Tailwind CSS
          <br />
          - Building robust backends with Node.js & Express
        </p>
